# Q6: Hailstone
# Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach, poses
# the following mathematical puzzle.
# Pick a positive integer n as the start.
# If n is even, divide it by 2.
# If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
# Continue this process until n is 1.
# The number n will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for all
# numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody has ever proved that the sequence
# will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the
# atmosphere before eventually landing on earth.
# This sequence of values of n is often called a Hailstone sequence. Write a
# function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name n, prints out
# the hailstone sequence starting at n, and returns the number of steps in the
# sequence:
